What is Kusama?

Polkadot's crazy brother, they are both governed together and have different implementations
Polkadot's savage parent, they both share the same initial codebase but got forked into separate projects
Polkadot's beserk child, they used to be the same chain but were split in a hard fork
Polkadot's wild cousin, they both share key innovations and are independently governed by the holders of their respective tokens
