Why can it be a good idea to use an Open Banking API Aggregator?

Because it makes it simpler to hook up to multiple banks and financial institutions APIs
Because it aggregates legal documents for API Access all around the world
Because it aggregates all APIs in a bank and makes it possible for you to access APIs beyond PSD2
Because it will save all data so that I donâ€™t have to access the bank APIs
