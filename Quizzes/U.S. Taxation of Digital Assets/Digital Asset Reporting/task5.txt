If I buy USDT with fiat, then I trade the USDT into ETH, is my transaction reportable or Taxable or both?

Reportable but not taxable
Taxable
Both. Report if you wish and yes, it is taxable. However the basis is the same in the USDT from the time I bought to the time I sell because it is a stable coin.
Neither.
