centralized exchanges lend out funds which leads to fractional banking

most dexs don't use order books
constant price formula x * y = k
if one token prices goes up then the other token price goes down

uniswap improved on this formula with constant liquidity that guarantees less slippage

what if there is no trading pair?
then order is auto routed through multiple pools
however it's 2 swaps happening and fees apply for both  of them

anyone can create a liquidity pool for 2 tokens if there isn't one already
