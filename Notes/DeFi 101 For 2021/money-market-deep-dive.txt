most common metric for defi success are
total value locked TVL
and market cap of the token

the risk depends on what tokens are actually locked in the protocol

ltv = loan to value - collateral to money lent out - key indicator to risk
higher ltv tend to have higher fees because there is more demand for lenders

a tokens are interest bearing

in compound the c token is not pegged to the original
price slowly increases in value depending on interest rate
