1. tech drawbacks
2. user experience drawbacks
3. regulatory drawbacks

transactions are immutable so pay attention, no chargebacks
don't reuse addresses
separate your personal identity from wallet addresses as much as possible

regular hacks, rug-pulls and scams are still happening because the space is so new

eth gas fees are high, so many people can't use defi - waiting for eth 2.0

you need to keep your own records for reporting
use 2fa authentication

in most places there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty
