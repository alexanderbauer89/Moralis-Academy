defi needs a smart contracts platform and ethereum was the first one
maker is considered the first defi protocol

etherdelta was the first attempt, but failed

defi protocols must either be fully decentralized or fully compliant

compound is another money market and created yield farming

yearn finance is an automatic yield optimizer - only way to get tokens is to use the protocol

sushiswap didn't had a token, it copied uniswap and added a token

sushi captured over a billion of liquidity from uniswap

polygon was formerly matic

ethereum has more liquidity, more developers and dapps already built on it -> network effects
