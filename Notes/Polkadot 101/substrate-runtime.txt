the runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behaviour

the runtime is referred to as the state transition function

frame defines additional runtime primitives and provides a framework that makes it easy to construct a runtime
by composing modules called pallets

pallets
each pallet encapsulates domain-specific logic that is expressed as a set of storage items, events, errors and dispatchable functions
pallets are special kind of rust modules from which the substrate runtime can be composed

runtime upgrades
in the frame sysyem, the system library defines a set_code call that is used to update the definition of the runtime
forkless runtime upgrades
the upgrade of the runtime logic can happen in real time without causing a fork

sudo pallet
allows for a single account to execute dispatchable functions

democracy pallet
handles adiministration of general stakeholder voting

collective pallet
members of a set of account IDs can make their collective feelings known
