substrate consensus

blockchain runtime is a state machine

blockchains must agree on:
some inital state, called genesis
a series of state transitions, each called a block
a final (current) state

all operations within a blockchains state transition function must be deterministic

forks occur when two blocks reference the same parent and must be resolved such that only one canoical chain exists
a fork choice rule is an algorithm that takes a blockchain and selects the "best" chain

longest chain rule (used by bitcoin and papa)

ghost says that starting at the genesis block, each fork is resolved by choosing the branch that has the most blocks built on it recusrivly

some nodes in the blockchain network are able to produce new blocks (authoring)

proof of work: any node may produce a block at any time as long as it has solved a computationally intensive problem

slots (used by polkadot and kusama)
a known set of validators who are permitted to produce blocks
time is divided into discrete slots and during each slot only some of the validators may produce a block

finality
users in any system want to know their transactions are finalized
using block authoring schemas and fork choice rules described so far, transactions are never entirely finalized
when deterministic finality is desired, a finality gadget can be added to the blockchain logic
