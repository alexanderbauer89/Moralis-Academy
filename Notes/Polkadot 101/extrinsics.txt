a piece of information that comes from outside the chain and is included in a block
a block in substrate is composed of a header and an array of extrinsics

inherents are pieces of informations that are not signed and only inserted in a block by the block author
represents data that, in a opinionated fashion, describes one of a number of valid pieces of information -
they are assumed to be true

signed transactions
contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction
unsigned transactions - transactions that is not signed, for example the i'm online heartbeat
(no fees, lack a nonce, no economical sense to prevent spam)

transaction pool
contains all transactions broadcasted by the network
checks for transaction validity:
transaction index (nonce)
account has enough funds
valid signature

transaction queue sorts transactions into two groups
ready queue - transactions that can be included in a block
future queue - transactions may become valid in the future (for example if nonce is too high for account)

custom runtime can modify strict transaction ordering requirements and implement unique strategies
