all blockchains on polkadot are connected to the relay chain
allows polkadot to process transactions from all chains in the network at the same time
provides a secure way for chains to communicate with each other and exchange any idea for example a token
chains can be optimised for a specific usecase

polkadot can support a number of execution slots (like cores on a computer)
two subscriptions models: parachains and parathreads
parathreads share slots among groups
both have the exact same API

bridges can connect non-parachain chains to polkadot network built as a parachain module
