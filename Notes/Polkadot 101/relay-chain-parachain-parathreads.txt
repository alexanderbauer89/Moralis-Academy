all blockchains on polkadot are connected to the relay chain
allows polkadot to process transactions from all chains in the network at the same time
provides a secure way for chains to communicate with each other and exchange any idea for example a token
chains can be optimised for a specific usecase

polkadot can support a number of execution slots (like cores on a computer)
two subscriptions models: parachains and parathreads
parathreads share slots among groups
both have the exact same API

bridges can connect non-parachain chains to polkadot network built as a parachain module

parachain is application-specific data structure that is globally coherent and validatable by the validators of the relay chain
able to parallelize transaction processing and achieve scalability
maintained by the network maintainer known as a collator

parathreads an idea for parachain to temporarily participate in polkadot security
